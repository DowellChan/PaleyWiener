The following is an abstract of my latest paper entitled "Paley-Wiener Theorem for Probabilistic Frames".

Abstract: The Paley-Wiener Theorem is a classical result about the stability of basis in Banach spaces claiming that if a sequence is close to a basis, then this sequence is a basis.  Similar results are also extended to frames in Hilbert spaces.  As the extension of finite frames for $\mathbb{R}^d$, probabilistic frames are probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with finite second moments and the support of which span $\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper generalizes the Paley-Wiener theorem to the probabilistic frame setting. We claim that if a probability measure is close to a probabilistic frame, then this probability measure is also a probabilistic frame.
